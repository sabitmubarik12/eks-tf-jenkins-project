# Assessment based Three-Tier Web Application Deployment on AWS EKS using AWS EKS, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, Sonarqube, terrascan/validiac and Jenkins.

Welcome to the Assessment based Three-Tier Web Application Deployment project! üöÄ

This repository hosts the implementation of a Three-Tier Web App using ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB, deployed on AWS EKS. The project covers a wide range of tools and practices for a robust and scalable DevOps setup.

### Table of Contents:

- Application Code
- Jenkins Pipeline Code
- Jenkins Remote State Code
- Jenkins Server Terraform
- Kubernetes Manifests Files
- EKS Remote State Code
- EKS Terraform Code

### Project Details

Application Code
The Application-Code directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the frontend and backend implementations.

Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the Jenkins-Pipeline-Code directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts. These scripts automate the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth integration and deployment of your application.

Jenkins Remote State Code
Explore the Jenkins_Remote_state_TF directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins remote state storage and dynamodb creation on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

Jenkins Server Terraform
Explore the Jenkins-Server-TF directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins Server on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

Kubernetes Manifests Files
The Kubernetes-Manifests-Files directory holds Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application on AWS EKS. Understand and customize these files to suit your project needs.

EKS Remote State Code
Explore the EKS_Remote_state_TF directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the EKS remote state storage and dynamodb creation on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

EKS Terraform Code
Explore the EKS_TF directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the EKS Cluster on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

### Project Details

##### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Explored:

Terraform & AWS CLI for AWS infrastructure
Jenkins, Sonarqube, ValdiIAC/Terrascan, Terraform, Kubectl, and more for CI/CD setup
Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for Monitoring
Helm, ELK Stack for Logging
ArgoCD for GitOps practices

##### üö¢ High-Level Overview:

IAM User setup & Terraform magic on AWS
Jenkins deployment with AWS integration
EKS Cluster creation & Load Balancer configuration
Private ECR repositories for secure image management
Helm charts for efficient monitoring setup
Helm charts for efficient logging setup
GitOps with ArgoCD - the cherry on top!
Gitlab for a fully automated workflow along with KLERA tools! For future references.

##### üìà The journey covered everything from setting up tools to deploying a Three-Tier app, ensuring data persistence, and implementing CI/CD pipelines.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, refer to my comprehensive guide/documentation attached in the zip file that walks you through IAM user setup, infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipeline configuration, EKS cluster creation, and more.

Hoping for the best! üöÄ
